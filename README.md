# BadBankApplication
 Bad Bank Application
This Application allows you to create an account at the bank, deposit money, withdraw money...etc. Although it is a bad bank that allows you to deposit and withdraw without creating an account, it still has rules that prevents you from being in over draft, prevents you from entering random characters that are not numbers, and prevents you from you entering negative values. 

How to Run:

1-Clone this repository

2-Open index.html file, explore, make changes, and upload to an AWS bucket or serve a local host on your computer to see what you can do. 

3-Enjoy!

Roadmap of future improvements: I am hoping to add a login page that will keep track of all users in the all data page.
